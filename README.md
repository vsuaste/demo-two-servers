# GraphQL backend
Skeleton NodeJS project for a graphQL server.

This package integrates the code generated by [code-generator](https://github.com/vsuaste/express_graphql_model_gen).

[Code-generator](https://github.com/vsuaste/express_graphql_model_gen) will generate four folders with the models' information:
* models
* schemas
* resolvers
* migrations

After getting ready the generated code for the models, proceed with the server set up.

## Set up
Clone the repository and run:
```
$ npm install
$ node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate
$ node server.js
```

``` $ node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate ``` command will create the tables specified in the ```migrations``` folder.
With credential as in ``` config/config.json``` file.

## Example of use
If you followed the example for generating the code described [here](https://github.com/vsuaste/express_graphql_model_gen), you can try the next queries and mutations. Otherwise, just adapt the same queries and mutations for your own models generated.

We will add the next 4 people to our table ``people``.

| Name (firstName) | Lastname (lastName) | Email (email) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Albert | Einstein | albert.einstein@science.com |
| Thomas | Edison | thomas.edison@science.com |
| Vicent | van Gogh | vicent.vanGogh@art.com |
| Ludwig | Beethoven  | ludwing.beethoven@art.com |

#### CREATE PERSON 

```
curl -XPOST http://localhost:3000/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/graphql' -d 'mutation M { addPerson(firstName: "Albert", lastName: "Einstein", email: "albert.einstein@science.com"){ firstName email } }'
```
As result we will get `firsName` and `email` of the person just created: 
```
{
  "data": {
    "addPerson": {
      "firstName": "Albert",
      "email": "albert.einstein@science.com"
    }
  }
}
```
In the same way we add the next 3 people:

```
curl -XPOST http://localhost:3000/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/graphql' -d 'mutation M { addPerson(firstName: "Thomas", lastName: "Edison", email: "thomas.edison@science.com") { firstName email } }'

curl -XPOST http://localhost:3000/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/graphql' -d 'mutation M { addPerson(firstName: "Vicent", lastName: "van Gogh", email: "vicent.vanGogh@art.com"){ firstName email } }'

curl -XPOST http://localhost:3000/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/graphql' -d 'mutation M { addPerson(firstName: "Ludwig", lastName: "Beethoven", email: "ludwig.beethoven@art.com"){ firstName email } }'
```

#### SEARCH PEOPLE WITH FILTER

We'll search people with 'science' as substring of their email and as result we'll get only their name and last name.

```
curl -XPOST http://localhost:3000/graphql -H 'Content-Type: application/graphql' -d '{ searchPerson(input:{field:email, value:{value:"%science%"}, operator:like}){ firstName lastName}}'
```
The result will be:

```
{
  "data": {
    "searchPerson": [
      {
        "firstName": "Albert",
        "lastName": "Einstein"
      },
      {
        "firstName": "Thomas",
        "lastName": "Edison"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
